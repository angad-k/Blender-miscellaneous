# Blender Shaders 

This is a collection of blender projects that I have made while learning how to use the shader graphs and other stuff. 
Though I have mainly focused on trying various setups in shader graphs, I have also included other stuff in here like volumetric lighting, particle systems, etc.

## Renders

### Default Cube Abduction :laughing:
I made this one to try out volumetric lighting, made a metal shader for the cube. 
I have also made a little animated clip of the same that you can watch [here](https://youtu.be/sLDfAJUIZCo).

### Rock :new_moon:
Starting from a sphere, the rock is completely designed using procedural nodes. Grass is added using particle system and volumetric lighting is added in the later renders.
I have iteratively improved the renders as shown below :

### Lava :volcano:
Doesn't look much like lava but looks pretty cool!
